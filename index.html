<h2>Math.random()</h2>
<p>-------------</p>
<p>
To generate a random number you use ‘Math.random()’. What is ‘Math’? What is the
return type of the ‘.random()’ method. Why is the ‘M’ in ‘Math’ capitalized (you may
need to investigate Static classes...hint hint).

‘Math.’ is a class of the java language that contains “methods for performing basic
numeric operations such as the elementary exponential, logarithm, square root, and
trigonometric functions.” The .random() method is a method in the ‘Math’ class that
will return “a double value with a positive sign, greater than or equal to 0.0 and
less than 1.0. Returned values are chosen pseudorandomly with (approximately) uniform
distribution from that range.” The ‘M’ in ‘Math’ is capitalized because it is a
top-level static class in the java language and the code will not run unless it is
written correctly. It is programming convention to capitalize the first letter of a
class. This is due to readability and conformity, this readability and conformity in
programing helps programmers create code that is easier to work with.</p>

<h2>Casting a double to an int</h2>
<p>--------------------------</p>
<p>What does it mean to ‘cast a double to an int’? Give an example of when you would do
this and explain what is happening.

When you ‘cast a double to an int’ you are converting a variable that used to be a
double into an int. Essentially you are deleting the remainder of a number and
creating a whole number. If you were to cast the double 10.345, to an int you would
end up with 10. You removed the .345 of the double because an int cannot have a
decimal. A programmer might want to cast a double to an int if they were using the
Math.random() method but wanted a whole number (an int). The .random() method will
return a random number between 0.0 and 1.0. The programmer would then multiply the
random number by a  whole number and finally cast that result to a int, resulting
in a random whole number.</p>

<h2>Switch if/else</h2>
<p>--------------</p>
<p>What is the difference between ‘switch’ and ‘if/else’? When would you use one versus
the other?</p>
<p>
As described by Oracle “the statements inside your source files are generally executed
from top to bottom, in the order that they appear. Control flow statements, however,
break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching,
enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.”  Both the
switch and if/else statements are control flow statements, but vary in how they execute
command and their possible outcomes. The ‘if/else’ statement is restrained to a two
prong execution path. (If something is true this will happen, if not that will happen.)
The switch statement differs in that it can have a number of different possible execution
paths. The switch statement contains different ‘cases’ and the program will look to see
if a given variable is equal to one or more of the ‘cases’. If the given variable is equal
to one of the cases the program will run the code within that case. The ‘switch’ statement
allows a programmer to clean up the code, making it more readable removing numerous stacked
if/else statement. Each has their benefit and every programmer is different in their use of
the if/else and switch statements, some programmers only use the if/else statement while
others swear by the switch statement. </p>

<h2>java.util.Scanner</h2>
<p>-----------------</p>
<p>What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code? Where does
this functionality come from? What is the ‘java’ in ‘java.util.Scanner;’?

There are 15 core packages in the java language. When a programmer wants to call up
these packages they first need to call the java language followed with the package,
(language.package or i.e. java.util). Within each package there are an assortment of
classes. These class contain all different types of functionalities that make the java
language what it is. The "java.util package contains the collections framework, legacy
collection classes, event model, date and time facilities, internationalization, and
miscellaneous utility classes." One of these such classes is the Scanner class. The
Scanner class is a simple text scanner which can parse primitive types and strings
using regular expressions, reading imput from the user. Using the whole import string
at the beginning of the code allows the programer to use some short hand code later
instead of writing out the entire code every time the scanner is used.

<h2>'void' vs a return</h2>
<p>-----------------------</p>
<p>
What is ‘void’ in a method declaration? How does this differ from declaring a method
with a return type?

As described by Oracle "a java method is a collection of statements that are grouped
together to perform an operation." At A basic description there are two types
of methods, one that returns a value or one that doesn't. The void declaration declares
that there is no return type and nothing is returned to the orignial code. On the other
hand there are many different return types that can be used that will return something
to the original code and can be used further within that orignial code.
